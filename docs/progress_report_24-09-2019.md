-   [**Rinty Chowdhury**](https://github.com/rintychy)  

    I was assigned to do two tasks. First task was to download the post-strom images from the NOAA.gov website. It took 
    me the first three weeks to finish the first task. Second task was to create a script to compressed the large size 
    .jpg image file. I have created an script to compress all the .jpg image file recursively. Due to the large file 
    size, it takes longer to upload an image on the UI. Smaller size image will easy uploable to the dashboard. This 
    task took me one week to finish it completely.
