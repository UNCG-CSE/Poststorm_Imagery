# Project Introduction

Research scientists studying the effects of storms on land in the path of travel
have for a long time needed a tool to help make sense of images taken and
analyze them for meaningful characteristics. In order for researchers to analyze
photos of storm-related imagery, we are trying to build a program that can
collect data, serve images to research teams in order to tag data, build
classifiers for labelling whether the image contains non-coastal, coastal, or
just all water, then from that, taking the coastal images and analyzing them
further to determine whether or not there is wash-over, the land is developed
and other characteristics important to understanding the images.

This will likely involve a long process of tagging the data and building a model
that can at least get started with segmentation or classification. For the first
part of the project, we have been dealing with the collection and preparation of
the images for our goals.

Explored statistical analysis on the image size of Hurricane Florence coastal versus inland images and used the log function to scale down the values. The mean of inland image sizes is greater than that of the coastal images. Plotted histograms for each data set and fitted them with a gamma distribution using method of moments. Attempted to use MLE and KDE but had syntax/library issues. I also ran into an issue where the classroom method for fitting the distribution didn't scale as needed. Used another method and plotted separately. Applied two tailed z-test on coastal images to find 97.5% confidence interval. I did not have other variables to apply correlation and null hypothesis testing. After the images are annotated, I'll return to statistical analysis of those data. 
Total time spent on task: 12 hours

Developed utility that inputs a GPS coordinate and outputs the image filename(s) that contains that lat/long point. Unlike image count script, it runs in O(n), hurray! Time spent on task: 5 hours.

#### What I did

1. Added user authentication with Auth0 service.
2. As a result remade the entire dashobard from stracth to incorporate the
   authentication. Made sure protected links would only allowed logged in users.
The above task took 2-3 weeks
3. Added endpoint to call python script to get the image a specific user is
   supposed to tag.
4. Added endpoint to call python script to skip an image.
5. Added endpoint to call python script to tag an image as an ocean and get the
   next image to tag.
6. Added endpoint to call python script to tag an image with the data from the
   form and get the next iamge to tag.
7. Added package.json scripts to build the webserver for production
items 3-7 took the last 3 weeks.
