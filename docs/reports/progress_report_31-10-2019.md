# Project Introduction

Research scientists studying the effects of storms on land in the path of travel have for a long time needed a tool
to help make sense of images taken and analyze them for meaningful characteristics. In order for researchers to analyze
photos of storm-related imagery, we are trying to build a program that can collect data, serve images to research teams
in order to tag data, build classifiers for labelling whether the image contains non-coastal, coastal, or just all
water, then from that, taking the coastal images and analyzing them further to determine whether or not there is
wash-over, the land is developed and other characteristics important to understanding the images.

This will likely involve a long process of tagging the data and building a model that can at least get started with
segmentation or classification. For the first part of the project, we have been dealing with the collection and
preparation of the images for our goals.
