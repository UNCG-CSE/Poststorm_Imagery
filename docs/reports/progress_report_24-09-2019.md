-   [**Rinty Chowdhury**](https://github.com/rintychy)  

    I was assigned to do two tasks. First task was to download the post-strom images from the NOAA.gov website. There were some initial         challeges in downloading large scale files. This was later resolved with the help of my teammates. Finally, it was completed in two         weeks. Second task was to create a script to compress the large size .jpg image file. I have created an script to compress all the         .jpg image file recursively. Due to the large file size, it takes longer to upload an image on the UI. Smaller size image will be           easily uploable to the dashboard. This task took me one week to finish it completely.
