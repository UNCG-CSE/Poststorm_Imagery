Introduction to the project:

Outlined tasks for each team member:
Rinty Chowdhury: I was assigned to do two tasks. First task was to download the post-strom images from the NOAA.gov website. It took me the
first three weeks to finish the first task. Second task was to create a script to compressed the large size .jpg image file. I have created
an script to compress all the .jpg image file recursively. Due to the large file size, it takes longer to upload an image on the UI. Smaller size
image will easy uploable to the dashboard. This task took me one week to finish it completely.
