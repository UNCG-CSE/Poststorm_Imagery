Export `C:\Projects\Python\Poststorm_Imagery\src\python` as `PYTHONPATH` to fix **'Module psic not found'**

Note, this can be done in *PyCharm* simply by adding `PYTHONPATH=<LOCATION OF Poststorm_Imagery FOLDER>/src/python`
to the run script specified under `Environment:` text box, making sure to replace the text in `<>` with the correct
path for your system.
